#README.md for Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project#

###Date: December 26, 2015##

This repo contains three files:

\* README.md explains how the scripts work and how they are connected.

\* CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I perfomed to clean up the data.

\* run_analysis.R contains the scripts for the project.  It does the following: 

1. merges the training and the test sets to create one data set;
2. extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement; 
3. uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set; 
4. appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names; and
5. from the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
